JAvascript -- uses esic as compiler 

java script is cas sensitive language 

Syntax for math 
+,-*./

order of operation 
BODMAS 

* / are done first -- it has same precedence and when both are there it work left to right 
+ - are done after -- it has same precedence and when both are there it work left to right 
() brackets have highest priority

2,3,4 integer numbers 
0.2.0.4 -- floating pointnumbers 
Math.round();


Strings
strings comes in sing quote '' -- 'hello'

concatination
'dsds'+'sdsd'+'dsd' =

type cohesion or type conversion 
'ksldk'+'2' = 'ksldk2'

check type = type of 'hello = strong' or type of 22 = numbers.
javaScript we cas use sing quptes and double quotes both .

"I'm learning JavaScript" -- this will work in the case where quote is present in the string

Escape Character :- 
letter , number , symbol are character but esape character is \'  -- it create next character as next character as text
\" create double quote
\n new line character

String 3rd way 
template string -- `your string` used for interpolation 

for eg:- `ITEMS(${1+1})` --`ITEMS(${1+1}):$${(2095+799)/100}` this is interpolation which is clear way

multi line string 
`some 
text`
'some \ntext'
'..' vs "..."
always use single quote as default


Variables :- 

cant use special words for variable :- foreg :- let

cant start with a number 

cant use specail characters except :- $ _
eg :- let $name =3 and let _name =3;

variable RE-assignment Shortcut 
+=2 variable = variable +2;
-=2 variable = variable -2;
/=2 variable = variable /2;
*=2 variable = variable *2;\
++  variable = variable +1
--  variable = variable -1

Naming Convention 
camelCase  nikhilVyas default
PascalCase NikhilVyas
kebab-case doesnt work in js but ued in html and css
snake_case nikhil_vyas

3 ways to create variable 
let varaible1; use when you know you need to change the value
const varaible2; --value stays constant can not be rechanged like final (use const by default)
var variable3=3; can be changed later it is the original way there is some issue that is why we can not use in new js code.

typeof -- used to know the type of value inside the variable.
